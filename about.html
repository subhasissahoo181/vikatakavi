Large-scale property speculators disliked the term "property speculator," therefore they coined the new term "residential development" to
                            characterize theirline of work. As farms and ranches were divided up and developed, it was common for one individual or organization to be in charge of all aspects of entitlement, land use, infrastructure development, and housing. Many of the same tactics that made autos affordable, such as standardization of design and small, repetitive assembly tasks, promotion, and a free flow of funding, also made housing affordable.As a result of mass production, goods become more uniform and people's lives become
                             more comfortable. city with apartments, advancements continued to be made with other products, Curving roads, parks beside greenways, neighbourhood pools, and monuments identifying community entrances all developed. There were several altitudes, different floor plans, and various room counts.

          <p>Real estate development, often known as property development, is a business process that includes everything from the purchase of undeveloped land through the selling of developed land or parcels to third parties. It also includes the renovation and re-leasing of existing buildings. All of these processes are coordinated by real estate developers, who turn concepts from paper into tangible assets. Although many developers also oversee the building of homes or manage the construction process, real estate development is distinct from other activities.</p>
        <p>Developers purchase land, finance real estate transactions, construct or hire builders to construct projects, develop projects in joint ventures, and design, envision, manage, and coordinate the entire development process. When real estate is built or renovated, developers often take on the biggest risk and get the biggest returns. Normally, developers buy a piece of land, decide how to market it, create a building programme and design, get the appropriate funding, build the structures, rent them out, manage them, and then sell the property.</p>
